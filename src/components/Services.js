            sometimes be accomodated.
            <br />
            We put a lot of thought into the groupings of our dogs to maximise
            the enjoyment of everyone concerned.
            <br />
            We collect from Cambridge City and the surrounding villages.

          Reiki For Dogs <br />
          Dogs intuitively understand this technique and will sometimes present
          the part of their body they would like worked on, before even
          starting. This technique is really effective to help your dog come to
          terms with many traumatic situations they may have encountered, for
          example:
          <br />
          <br />
          Dog attack
          <br />
          Fireworks
          <br />
          Surgery
          <br />
          Veterinary Treatment
          <br />
          <br />
          It relaxes and calms your pet and helps you become more bonded. It
          also helps with general relaxation, arthritis, tummy upsets, nerves
          and behaviourial issues
          <br /> <br />
          This simple technique has 3 main parts: <br />
          Breathing <br />
          Meditation <br />
          Spiral work (hands on or from a distance) <br /> <br />
          These medatative practices help you and your dog to be at one with
          each other. Concentrating on the breath encourages you to let
          everything go, except your presence and your intent to help your dog.
          These sessions can be done in groups or one to one. <br />
          <br />
          Stewie's Story <br />
          Stewie's story perfectly illustrates the powerful effects possible
          from Canine Reiki. Stewie is a timid, nervous and very reactive Shiba
          Inu. He was caged for 4 years of his life, until a a client (Janice)
          rescued him and took him back to her Shiba rescue to help him find a
          loving forever home. Because of Stewie's past, he was very reactive
          and unpredictable and with no warning or indication of his intent, he
          would bite. Janice has never come across this and most dogs would be
          put to sleep, but she didnt give up. She contacted me and I went to
          meet her and Stewie. You couldn't touch him, brush him or wash him. I
          started to work with him from afar at first, with my intent to help
          him relaxing and open his heart chakra, and start to trust what I was
          doing. Using simple spiral movements from a distance, concentrating on
          his body. Within twenty mins, I could see him dropping and his eyes
          got heavy and he lay down and started to trust me. Slowly, but
          carefully I moved closer to him and finally after thirty minutes I was
          able to touch him, stroke him and reassure him that I was here to
          help. This was only in one session, it was amazing and I felt so
          overwhelmed that could help this beautiful boy.
