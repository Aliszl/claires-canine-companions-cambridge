       <p>Exciting new beginnings in 2021.
          My partner, the team and I are creating a wonderful doggy creche based in Downham Market

8 acres of land, based within the fenland, 
with a sensory garden,
doggy pool,
chill out rooms,
under floor heating in the doggy rooms,
groom room with a wash bath for the pooches

Fully cameraed so you can see what your dog has been up to.
Electric and password front gates, monitored at all times</p>
