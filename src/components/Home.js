      "We think Claire is a wonderful dog walker/house sitter. She looked after our wonderful dog, Max, in our home for 3 ½ weeks when were on holiday and we have asked her back since then. Max  has a number of issues which Claire was very happy to deal with, even taking him to the vet as requested by us. She kept us in touch with how he was doing and was always available by texting. She is full of common sense, totally trustworthy and clearly adores dogs and is very experienced. And it was clear from the start that Max was very happy with Claire. She went that extra mile with advice and ideas to help Max with his anxiety issues – all very welcome, not at all pushy. Claire is really lovely and very easy to talk to. We felt very relaxed when we were away in the knowledge that Max was being very well looked after with some very relaxing doggy massage thrown in too! Our house too was well looked after and clean and tidy when we returned!",

She is very thoughtful and caring in her approach to walking and looking after them whilst in her care. The dogs re her top priority and she has worked with us to help one of the dogs behavioural issues and the other with food issues. She shows such passion and dedication in all aspects of her work and it very trustworthy. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her for dog walking or pet sitting.",

Claire was so sweet and patient whilst I put her through the mill of questions and more questions and finally a trial dog walk with me in tow! She immediately put me at ease and Hugo just adores his Auntie Claire. I would highly recommend her to anyone!",

      "It took me over a year to take the plunge to find a dog walker as I was so nervous to trust anyone else with my dog. Claire quickly put my mind at ease and assured me that no risks would ever be taken and that Roxy would  be in safe hands. Roxy has now been enjoying regular walks with Claire for almost 3 years and I have peace of mind knowing that she's out having fun and socialising when I'm at work - and I always get home to a tired and happy dog.  Claire always updates me with a text to let me know how they got on and that she's safely home again. Claire's experience in Reiki is also a huge benefit, particularly on days that are too hot (or too rainy!) to walk, Roxy still gets some quality time and attention. I trust Claire completely with a key to my home and with Roxy and wouldn't hesitate for a moment to recommend her to others.",

She is always happy to go with her and happy when she comes back. I know she is in safe hands and Claore always gives her 100% attention and care while I am away. It gives me a sense of ease while I am away to know she is in good hands and very well looked after.",

The house is always tidy and clean when we return and Millie has had a fantastic time and looks sad when she says goodbye to her.  William her greyhound stays with her in the house too and there is never a problem, Millie loves him so much and they have snuggles on the sofa. Now William has passed away, her new dog Spock stays and again never any problems and Millie has a new friend to play with.  I trust Claire 100% with Millie and the house. Whenever I need advice or a doggy chat she is there and is always helpful and commited to what she does. She has a natural flare and talent with dog's and you can see she is passionate in what she does.",

I found them by bumping into one of Claire's Walkers out with dogs on the Roman Road.  I was struck by how happy all the dogs looked.  The team is big enough to be able to cover sick leave etc and be reliable and small enough to know all the dogs personally ",

Claire spends the time and effort to not only exercise the dogs, but to pair them in size and personalities to get the most out of the sessions. We have seen vast improvements in Bonnie's behaviour, such as her confidence and her ability to assess new dogs and people quickly. It’s lovely to hand her over each day seeing her tail waggle and knowing she is in great hands. We highly recommend Claire’s Canine Companions.",
