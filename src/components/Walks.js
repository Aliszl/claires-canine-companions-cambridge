      <h2>Walks</h2>
      <p>


We walk 7 days a week including weekends and bank holidays
(there is no extra charge for Sundays and Bank Holidays).

<br/>
<br/>
1 hour walk<br/>
£15 per hour (1 dog)<br/>
£20 per hour (2 dogs)
<br/>
<br/>
An hours walk, means a full hours walk.  We do not cut corners.<br/><br/>

We walk a maximum of 6 dogs at one time, though individual walks can sometimes be 
accomodated.  
<br/>
We put a lot of thought into 
the groupings of our dogs to maximise the enjoyment of everyone concerned.
<br/>
We collect from Cambridge City and the surrounding villages
 (We also cover Horningsea, Fulbourn, Girton, Impington).
  Outer areas (e.g. Milton, Sawston and Shelford ) are charged at 0.40 per mile from where I live.
  <br/><br/>
  Dog Walking Hours<br/>
We  keep to these dog walking hours to ensure we are not out at dusk.
Summertime - 8am - 7pm
Wintertime - 8am - 4pm


Off lead walking <br/>
This will be decided on a case by case basis and is very 
dependent on the individual dog and owner preference.
Where it is safe and legal to do so, and with your permission,
 we like to give dogs some off lead time
 
 
All our walkers have their favorite places, but some of our regular walks include
 Byron's pool, 
 Granchester Meadows, 
 The Roman road, 
 Anglesey Abbey, 
 Impington Woods, 
 Thetford Forest,
 and walks in Haslingfield, Wilbraham, Lode.


We all take cleaning up dog mess very seriously.
We leave nothing but footprints and take nothing but memories
 (and our poo bags)
