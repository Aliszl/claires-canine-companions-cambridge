       <p>All boarding is currently done in our homes, rather than kennels
          so it is a very relaxed, homely environment. <br/> We will 
          continue to offer one on one domestic boarding where that is the best fit, 
          but to extend our service we also have exciting future plans 
          to develop a property, using our skills and knowledge about what
           makes a happy dog and to extend our capacity.   
           <br/>
         This is a longtime dream and something of a passion project. 
          My partner and I, are purchasing a wonderful home,
          our own slice of Fenland countryside heaven, near Downham Market. 
          We are developing a  doggy creche in 8 acres of land devoted to the dogs, 
          meadows, a sensory garden, doggy pool, chill out rooms and socialising spaces, 
          doggy bedrooms with under floor heating and a groom room with a wash bath. 
          
          
          We know how unsettling it can be to leave your furbabies,
           so all areas will be covered by webcam so you can see what your dog is up to at all times.
