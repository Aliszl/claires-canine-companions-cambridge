       <p>We provide over night stays for as long as you require. From just one night to several weeks can all be accomodated. All boarding is currently done in our homes, rather than kennels
          so it is a very relaxed, homely environment.
          <br/> <br/> Â£35 per day <br/> 
          <br/>
          We provide for all your pups needs, both physical and emotional 
          whilst you are on holiday or seeing to other responsibilities.

          <p>We will 
          continue to offer one on one domestic boarding where that is the best fit, 
          but to extend our service and capacity we also have exciting future plans 
          to develop a property to provide boarding and daycare, that is a world away from kennels, using our skills and knowledge about what
           makes a happy dog.   
           <br/> <br/>
         This is a longtime lifestyle dream and something of a passion project. <br/>
          My partner and I are purchasing a wonderful new home,
          our own slice of Fenland countryside heaven, near Downham Market. 
          We are developing a  doggy creche nestled in 8 acres of land entirely devoted to dogs.
          Meadows, a sensory garden, doggy pool, chill out rooms and socialising spaces, 
          doggy bedrooms with under floor heating and a groom room with a wash bath. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We know how unsettling it can be to leave your furbabies in the care of another, they are family after all,
           so all areas will be covered by webcam so you can see what your dog is up to at all times. 
          We are confident enough in our skills and the service we provide to be entirely and radically open.
